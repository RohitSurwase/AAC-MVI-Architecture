/**
 * Create ViewModel by extending this class.
 *
 * @param STATE ViewState should represent the current state of the view at any given time.
 * So this class should have all the variable content on which our View is dependent.
 * Every time there is any user input/action we will expose modified
 * copy (to maintain the previous state which is not being modified) of this class.
 * We can create this model using Kotlin's 'data class'.
 *
 * @param EFFECT ViewEffect is useful for actions that are fire-and-forget and we do not
 * want to maintain its state. We can create this class using Kotlin's 'sealed class'.
 *
 * @param EVENT Represents all actions/events a user can perform on the View.
 * This is used to pass user input/action to the ViewModel.
 * We can create this events set using Kotlin's 'sealed class'.
 *
 * @property process(viewEvent: EVENT) Process ViewEvents (viewEvent) passed by Activity/Fragment/View
 *                                     and update ViewState and ViewEffect accordingly.
